## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Project Objectives
- Explore and analyze the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends.
- Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory analysis.
- Create data visualizations to communicate findings.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found in the same GitHub repository as the source code.

### Dataset Features
The dataset used in this project has the following features:

- **name**: Name of the restaurant
- **online_order**: Indicates if the restaurant supports online orders (Yes/No)
- **book_table**: Indicates if the restaurant supports table booking (Yes/No)
- **rate**: Rating of the restaurant
- **votes**: Number of votes the restaurant has received (on a scale of 5)
- **approx_cost**: Approximate cost for two people

## Key Insights and Findings
- The majority of the restaurants fall under the **Dining** category.
- **Dining** restaurants are preferred by a larger number of individuals.
- The restaurant with the maximum number of votes is *Empire Restaurant*.
- Majority of the restaurants do not accept online orders.
- The majority of restaurants received ratings ranging from **3.5 to 4**.
- The approximate cost preferred is found to be **300 rupees**.
- **Offline orders** received lower ratings compared to **online orders**.
- **Dining** restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas **cafes** mainly receive online orders. This suggests that customers prefer to place orders in person at restaurants but prefer online ordering at cafes.
